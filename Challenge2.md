### Solution
This time nonces are not same but they are generated by faulty random number generator.

Let us solve now:
```
since both signatures have similar nonces, here k

s1 = k1 + H(x || PubKey || H(m1))*PrivKey

s2 = k2 + H(x || PubKey || H(m2))*PrivKey 

since, H(m1) and H(m2) wll generate different hashes


s1 = k1 + H1*PrivKey  ...(1)

s2 = k2 + H2*PrivKey  ...(2)


substract equation 1 from equation 2

PrivKey = (s2 - s1) - (k2 - k1) / (H2 - H1)

since k2 = a*k1 + b, so k2 - k1  = k1*(a - 1) + b

PrivKey = (s2 - s1) - (k1*(a - 1) + b) / (H2 - H1)

```
